Made with five other people as part of the Nordic Game Jam 2024, we knew we wanted to do something with a physical hardware component. We ended trying to capture that feeling of running around with a toy spaceship in your hand, going "pew pew pew".

The game is made in Unity and the controller was built with LEGO MINDSTORMS. I was responsible for the hardware integration, and having to reinvent <i>somewhat</i> accurate motion controls with just an accelerometer was a really fun challenge.
