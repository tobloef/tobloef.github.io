The site you're viewing right now is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a framework which I have enjoyed working with a lot. The original version of this site was made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but I ended up ditching it due to lack of flexibility.

For this version of the site, I had three primary goals, all of which Astro has fit perfectly.

- Opt-in coding. For smaller blog posts, a simple markdown file should be sufficient. For more complex posts, I wanted to be able to drop down into code-land again and write the components I needed.
- Instant load times. I've grown tired of webpages being slow when they shouldn't. By keeping it simple and near JavaScript-less, I wanted a site with a Lighthouse score of 100.
- A simple but pleasing UI, designed for longer text-based content. Should be intuitive to navigate, quick to develop and support readability features such as dark mode.
