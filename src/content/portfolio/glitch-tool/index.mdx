During the summer of 2018 I had the opportunity to take part of a small community art exhibition. Lacking traditional art skills, I decided to experiment with [glitch art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art). For this purpose I created a command-line tool to mess up image files in a number of different ways.

The tool was created in Python and manipulates raw bytes in order to generate interesting results. Since it just manipulates bytes regardless of file format, it can be used to generate a large variety of effects based on what image format is used.

Occasionally people will send me things they have created with the tool, which brings me great joy.
