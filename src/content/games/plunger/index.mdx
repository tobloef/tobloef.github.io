This prototype started out as me wanting to experiment with mesh deformation shaders, so I came up with this idea of a bendy plunger flopping around a level. After proving the initial tech, I focused on making the character controller of the plunger feel great, adding various visuals and sound effects to juice up the experience.

In the end I think it ended up being really satisfying just flinging the plunger around, even in very simple debug environments. That sentiment seemed to be shared by others, as clips of the prototype went viral on TikTok with about 2 million views. I also got people to try the prototype (and around 20 minutes of frustratingly difficult levels) at a local LAN party, which was good fun.
