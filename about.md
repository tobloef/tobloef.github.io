Hi, I'm Tobias LÃ¸fgren, a passionate software engineer from Denmark. By day I work as full stack engineer at [ClearVoyage](https://clearvoyage.com/) and by night I tinker with all sorts of fun side projects, some of which I write about on this site. 

Feel free to follow me on twitter [@tobloef](https://www.twitter.com/tobloef).
