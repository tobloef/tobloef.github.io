Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

This is a footnote[^1].
[^1]: My reference.


1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

```js title="my-test-file.js"
console.log('This code is syntax highlighted!')
```

And now:

```js
console.log('This code is syntax highlighted!')
```

Highlights:

```js {1, 4, 7-8}
// Line 1 - targeted by line number
// Line 2
// Line 3
// Line 4 - targeted by line number
// Line 5
// Line 6
// Line 7 - targeted by range "7-8"
// Line 8 - targeted by range "7-8"
```

Diff:

```js title="line-markers.js" del={2} ins={3-4} {6}
function demo() {
  console.log('this line is marked as deleted')
  // This line and the next one are marked as inserted
  console.log('this is the second inserted line')

  return 'this line uses the neutral default marker type'
}
```

Labels, very cool:

```jsx {"1. Provide the value prop here:":5-6} del={"2. Remove the disabled and active states:":8-10} ins={"3. Add this to render the children inside the button:":12-15}
// labeled-line-markers.jsx
<button
  role="button"
  {...props}

  value={value}
  className={buttonClassName}

  disabled={disabled}
  active={active}
>

  {children &&
    !active &&
    (typeof children === 'string' ? <span>{children}</span> : children)}
</button>
```
