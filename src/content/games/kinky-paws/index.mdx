I had a lot of fun making this Unity game with four other people during the 2024 Nordic Game Jam. While not as technically ambitious as some of the other jams games I've participated in, it's for sure the best looking one! It was great working with actual artists, not to mention the lovely romantic music we managed to write and record.
