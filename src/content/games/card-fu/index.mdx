A clone of Club Penguin's [Card-Jitsu](https://www.cplegacy.com/cardjitsu), this game was made from scratch using web technologies such as [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) for graphics and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) for multiplayer.

Essentially an advanced form of rock-paper-scissors, but with a unique scoring mechanic, players would try to predict which cards their opponent would play. To win, you had to win with sets of cards with either identical or all-unique attributes, which meant you had an fighting chance of guessing which cards your opponents would play, making it a fair bit more interesting than normal rock-paper-scissors.

I think this project is where I first noticed the power of the web as a platform for games. You get a lot of capabilities for free, and the barrier to entry for players is extremely low. The game's size coming in at under a megabyte, time-to-play is virtually instant, which was a stark contrast to for example Unity's WebGL exports (especially at the time).
