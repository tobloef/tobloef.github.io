Smart industrial vending machine solution for the automotive industry. With capabilities such as tracking inventory with weight sensors and automatically sending refill orders, this was a project with a lot of moving parts. A [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based kiosk app running on the machines, a [React.js](https://react.dev/)-based web dashboard for managing the machines, and hardware controlled by custom [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) boards programmed in a C-like language.

I was the primary developer on this project and was responsible for almost all development on both the kiosk app, web dashboard and the hardware integration. Being still in high school at the time, this was my first large project in a professional setting, and I feel quite lucky to have gotten such a good opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.
