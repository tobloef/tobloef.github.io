The site you're viewing right now is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a framework which I have enjoyed working with a lot. The original version of this site was made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but I ended up ditching it due to lack of flexibility.

For this version of the site, I had three primary goals, all of which Astro has fit perfectly.

- Opt-in coding. For smaller blog posts, a simple markdown file should be sufficient. For more complex posts, I wanted to be able to drop down into code-land again and write the components I needed.
- Instant load times. I've grown tired of webpages being slow when they shouldn't. By keeping it simple and near JavaScript-less, I wanted a site with a Lighthouse score of 100.
- A simple but pleasing UI, designed for longer text-based content. Should be intuitive to navigate, quick to develop and support readability features such as dark mode.

For the portfolio, I had two additional goals that I wanted to tackle without resorting to client-side JavaScript:

- Spice up the page transitions a bit with the thumbnail images shifting into cover images. I ended up accomplishing this with [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API), a very interesting API that I'm excited to look more into. I was surprised by how SPA-like you could make an MPA (in a good way, hah!).
- Sorting and filtering of portfolio items. Given that the site is _not_ server-side rendered, I ended up getting a bit creative with Astro's static site generation. Filtered and sorted results are essentially all pre-generated at compile-time, something which I could probably only do because I know my scope was limited.
