TypeScript-based 3D rasterizer written completely from scratch. It does not use a 3D graphics library like WebGL or WebGPU, and instead relies only on a simple HTML5 canvas and a function to put a single put pixel on the screen (hence the name). This means that it runs on the CPU, making it quite slow for any practical purposes.

Performance was an explicit non-goal, however. I built the renderer to learn more about the math and technical hoops required to render 3D graphics, knowledge I would later carry over to my WebGPU work.

Putpix supports point lights, directional lights, and ambient lights. It also supports textures and smooth shading, as well as loading models from .obj files.
